Main idea:
 - MVP: Users can input what they ate for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Ideally can prompt them out every day with a notification to fill out what they ate. 
 - Carbon emmisions (from farming to transportation) from https://ourworldindata.org/environmental-impacts-of-food
 - Every workspace has a "Food Impact" board, which contains the leaderboard for everyone in their, plus a page for company wide leaderboard
 - Find a website to get the composition for every meal
 - User can enter the number of cups or grams their meal was
 
 Notes:
  - Sabih - recommending we use React + Firebase Firestore.
  - Ziva knows Figma UI
 
 Next steps, touch base Saturday:
 - Set up app - Sabih
 - Find a website to get the composition for every meal - Ziva
 - Look at what tech stack we should use + data storage - Everyone, Thursday let's decide tech stack
 - Research how Monday works with how apps look - Ziva
 - Research how Monday apps are made - Everyone

Good to have:
- Auto fill out if user inputted their meals into a fitness app
- Land usage, water usage, and landfill waste
- Add predetermined cup sizes for small vs. medium vs. large, or let them choose a specific number, and have pictures of 1, 2, 3 cups of rice, as reference
so they can estimate their food without having to measure it

food challenge with colleagues
- maybe integrating with different calorie counting/fitness apps and comparing
  - further down the road
- add sustainability/food waste component
